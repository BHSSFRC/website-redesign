									<h3 style="text-align:center;">Who Are The Quadrangles?</h3>
									<p style="text-align:center;">We are part of FIRST Robotics Competition, one of the four youth programs run by FIRST that provides the opportunity and resources for students and participants on each team to collaborate with each other to create a competitive robot. This hands-on experience allows our members to engage in science, technology, engineering, and math outside of a classroom setting.</p>
									<p style="text-align:center;">Established in 2011, The Quadrangles have participated in seven FIRST Robotics Competition seasons thus far. We are very excited as we enter our eighth season. Over the past seven years, our team has grown beyond Bloomington High School South's Robotics Club, and now welcomes all high school age students in Monroe County. The Quadrangles consists of about 20-30 student members and five mentors of various professional backgrounds ranging from engineering and programming to marketing, machining, and other things. Although we are a student-run team, we are supported by two main mentors: Chris Hacker, a local electrical engineer and Cindy Kvale, a science teacher at Bloomington High School South.</p>

									<h3 style="text-align:center;">What do The Quadrangles do?</h3> 
									<p style="text-align:center;">Our returning students lead groups of specified interest in machining, designing, programming, wiring, building or marketing as they help and work with new members. Mentors help guide conversation and assist in any way possible with their unique expertise. Everyone on the team is always actively participating and learning while contributing to the team throughout the whole year. Activities range from building and testing prototypes, CAD designing, and Java programming to grant writing, marketing and prepping for awards.</p>
									<p style="text-align:center;">By the end of each season, members gain a valuable set of new, life-long skills and experiences that will benefit them for future success. These are used as student members of The Quadrangles continue their academic career into college, and then on to STEM related careers. We pride ourselves on our teamâ€™s ability to foster an interest and passion for STEM fields within students and the community.</p>
