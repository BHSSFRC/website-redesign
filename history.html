								<h3 style="text-align:center;">2018: <b><i>FIRST</i></b> Power UP</h3>
								<p>The theme of this season was “Power Up!” in which robots had to manipulate cubes and place them on scales. Points were awarded based on the time that the scale was tipped towards your side. At the end of each match, robots had to climb at least one foot off of the scale platform so that they could face the boss. We solved this problem by using ramps to lift two other robots a foot off the ground. As a team, we won the quality award for our innovative carbon fiber ramps, which were manufactured entirely in our lab. Despite not qualifying for state, our head mentor Cindy Kvale won the Woodie Flowers award, the most prestigious award a mentor can receive, at the state level.</p>

								<h3 style="text-align:center;">2017: <b><i>FIRST</i></b> Steamworks</h3>
								<p> The theme of this season was "steampunk." Robots were made to deliver fuel to boilers and gears to an airship. The gears were used by human pilots to spin the airship rotors and prepare the airship to take flight. Points were primarily awarded for shooting small balls (fuel) into the boiler, spinning the rotors on the airship, and climbing the airship ropes. The Quadrangles competed in and won the Southwest Virginia Event and competed in the St. Joseph District Event. The team went on to win the Engineering Inspiration award at the Perry Meridian District Event amd the Indiana FIRST District championship, qualifying us for the FIRST championship in St. Louis. At worlds we had our best record in qualifications ever, with 9 wins and 1 loss, ultimately ranking 11th overall, and moving up to 8th alliance captain during alliance selection.</p>

								<h3 style="text-align:center;">2016: <b><i>FIRST</i></b> Stronghold</h3>
								<p>In 2016, The Quadrangles competed in the IN District Tippecanoe Event and Perry Meridian Event. Incorporating a medieval theme, this year's game involved robots breaching their opponents’ defenses, capturing their tower by first shooting "boulders", and then scaling the tower. Points were awarded by crossing the various obstacles (defenses) multiple times, shooting soft-foam balls (boulders) into either the high or low goal of the tower, surrounding the tower on its batter, and scaling/climbing the tower.</p>

								<h3 style="text-align:center;">2015: Recycle Rush</h3>
								<p> In 2015, The Quadrangles competed in the Kokomo City Indiana District Event in Kokomo, IN, as well as the Indianapolis Indiana District Event in Indianapolis, IN. We placed 2nd as finalists at the Kokomo City Indiana District Event, resulting in our qualification for the Indiana FIRST District Championship. In addition, we also earned the Quality Award at Kokomo. The objective of Recycle Rush was to stack up to 6 recycling totes on top of each other, and place them on scoring platforms. Additional points were added for having a recycling container on top of the stack. During qualification matches, bonus-cooperation points were rewarded at the end of the match for both alliances that worked together stack yellow totes in the middle of the field on the step. Points were deducted if pool noodles or "litter" were left in the auto zone at the end of the match.</p>

The objective of Ariel Assist was to shoot large exercise balls in to high and low goals the far end of each field. Bonus points were awarded for robots within the same alliance that assisted each other by passing a ball down the field.</p>

Placing first at the Midwest Regional in the tournament, we qualified for an opportunity to compete at the FIRST Championships in St. Louis.  Honoring Jack Kamen, who designed the FIRST Logo, the objective of this year's game is to place inflated tubes shaped like components of the FIRST logo onto metal pegs and release mini-bots to climb a metal pole. Extra points were awarded for placing the shapes of FIRST's logo in the correct order.</p>
